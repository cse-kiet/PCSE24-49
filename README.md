ABSTRACT: The increasing incidence of leaf diseases in agricultural crops has neces-sitated the development of efficient and automated detection methods to safeguard crop health and maximize yield. In the field of artificial intelligence, deep learning has emerged as a major computing paradigm with immense potential for solving a broad spectrum of computer vision problems. CNN is a type of deep learning architecture that is designed to provide accurate results for tasks such as image recognition and object detection. This study utilizes state-of-the-art (CNN) models to identify and classify plant leaf diseases. We have tested and assessed the performance of VGG16, Inception V4, AlexNet, and ResNet 50. Leveraging the power of deep learning, particularly transfer learning, this study presents a strong model which has the potential to accurately classify plant leaf diseases based on high- resolution images. The proposed methodology involves dataset curation, preprocessing, and fine- tuning of the ResNet-50 architecture, demonstrating its efficacy in automating leaf disease identification. Upon examining the results, ResNet50 has demonstrated good outcomes in the identification and categorization of plant leaf dis-eases with an accuracy of 99.85%.\
